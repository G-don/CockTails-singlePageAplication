##Instructions

Cocktailz is a simple single-page application that allows you to search for cocktail recipes and discover the best recipe for your favorite spirit. With just a click of a button, you can get a list of instructions and ingredients with measures. And if you search for a spirit that doesn't exist, Cocktailz will give you an error message. For each drink, you can also get more details or even watch a video by clicking on a link that takes you to a YouTube playlist of videos related to that specific cocktail.
